# Write a REST API for the input of calories in Python

### Task Instructions

- Each entry has a date, time, text, and number of calories.
- If the number of calories is not provided, the API should connect to a Calories API provider (for example, https://www.nutritionix.com) and try to get the number of calories for the entered meal.
- User setting ‚Äì Expected number of calories per day.
- Each entry should have an extra boolean field set to true if the total for that day is less than the expected number of calories per day, otherwise should be false.
